Test job. I am not sure that it is allowed to lay out the task itself, so I will describe the essence in a short.
You must write a static method that takes a string and an array.
Exmaple: 
    String "T1001,, "
    Array ["T1001,, ,T1002,", "T1002, , T2004] 

Check in all found items in the array and output the file to .csv
