Test job. I am not sure that it is allowed to lay out the task itself, so I will describe the essence in a short.
You must write a static method that takes a string and an array.
Exmaple: 
    String "T1001,, "
    Array ["T1001,, ,T1002,", "T1002, , T2004] 

It's assumed that the string stores no more than 3 values and the number of values is not equal to 0,
and the values begin with the letter
Input data: 
    String = ",T1006"
    array = ["T1004, ,T1006, T1007,","T1006, ,T1001, ,","T1009, ,T1005"]

````
- [x] Check in all found items in the array and output the file to .csv
- [x] Also write the necessary tests
